The purpose of this website is to assist you in determining whether an employer is insured for workers' compensation. This website will\n        provide the name of the insurer that wrote a California workers' compensation policy for a specific employer on a specific date within a 5-year period. No automated retrieval is permitted.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 class=\"mt-3 fw-bold\">Limitations of Coverage Information Available</h2>\n    <p>\n        The failure of an employer to appear in response to a query does not mean that the employer does not have insurance or is operating in violation of California law. Some employers\n        are legally self-insured; inquiries regarding self-insured employers should be directed to the\n        <a href=\"http://www.dir.ca.gov/osip/sip.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Office of Self Insurance Plans website</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Coverage information may not be available or complete for all employers due to limitations with the policy information, such as similar or duplicate employer names, multiple or alternate\n        locations and addresses for employers, or more than one named insured employer on an insurance policy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This website only provides coverage information for 5 years prior to the date of the query.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Search results may not reflect recent changes in information. Insurers have up to 30 days to report policy information to the WCIRB pursuant to the Insurance Commissioner's regulations contained in the  \n        <em>California Workers’ Compensation Uniform Statistical Reporting Plan – 1995</em>. Policy information reported by insurers is available\n        on this website within 30 days of being received by the WCIRB. Therefore, your search results may not\n        reflect coverage information changes that have occurred within the last 60 days.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The WCIRB's coverage records reflect the employer’s name as shown on the insurance policy. If you are searching for an employer name that is not on the policy, your search will return no results.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The WCIRB's Federal Employment Identification Number (FEIN) records are not complete. Searches based solely on the FEIN may provide no results.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 class=\"mt-3 fw-bold\">Information Displayed is Not Proof of Coverage</h2>\n    <p>\n        The results of your query are not evidence or verification of workers' compensation insurance, which should be obtained from or verified by the insurer directly. The results of a query\n        should be confirmed both with the employer and the insurer before it is used for any purpose.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 class=\"mt-3 fw-bold\">Where to Find Insurer Contact Information</h2>\n    <p>\n        To look up contact information for California insurance companies, visit the\n        <a href=\"https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=144:1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Department of Insurance website</a>.\n    </p>\n</div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"modal-footer\">\n                <form id=\"acceptDisclaimer-form\" name=\"acceptDisclaimer-form\">\n                    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"reCaptchaResponse\" id=\"reCaptchaResponse\" />\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                        <div class=\"col-7\">\n                            <p><span>By clicking \"Accept\", you affirm that you have read and understand the notices and disclaimers on this page.</span></p>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6\">\n                            \n    <script src=\"https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?onload=_turnstileCb\" async defer>\n    </script>\n    <div class=\"float-end mt-2\">\n        <div id=\"myWidget\"></div>\n        <a id=\"aDecline\" href=\"/\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" aria-label=\"Decline and exit\">Decline</a>\n        <button class=\"cf-turnstile btn btn-primary\" disabled onclick=\"return Coverage.Disclaimer.acceptDisclaimer();\"\n                data-action='button' id=\"btnAccept\" name=\"btnAccept\" aria-label=\"Accept the disclaimer\">\n            Accept\n        </button>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        function _turnstileCb() {\n            turnstile.render(turnstile.execute('#myWidget', {\n                sitekey: '0x4AAAAAAAiuMjQSie-C6EV7',\n                callback: function (token) {\n                    $('#reCaptchaResponse').val(token).trigger('change');                    \n                }\n            }));\n        }\n    </script>\n\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </form>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>","errors":[],"errorTag":"InvalidSession"}
